# Design-and-Analysis-of-6T-SRAM-Cell-
Analysed the working of SRAM Architecture ( 6T SRAM cell, Pre-charge circuit, Isolation Circuit, Sense amplifier and Write driver circuit) on GPDK 180 nm technology. Performed the read/write operations and analyzed SRAM cell stability through the Butterfly curve.
